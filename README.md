This is a repository containing all the Java files for solving the Eight Puzzle problem using the Eclipse IDE.
Unfortunately, there are no files that solve the problem by performing Uniform Cost Search or A* search, and it cannot be run from the command line.
So for the people looking for the solution code for the Eight Puzzle problem in an Artificial Intelligence class (COMPSCI 383 at UMass), I apologize for coming up short.
This is currently the solution code for the Search project in COMPSCI 186 and 187 at UMass.

A later update with the feature of testing the code from the command line will be made available by March 2020 (latest estimate).
The update will include classes that solve the problem by performing Uniform Cost search and A* search.
